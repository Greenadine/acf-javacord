> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project has been abandoned as I no longer have intentions to further develop it since I personally moved away from using Javacord. Anyone that would like to continue this project is free to do so.

ACF-Javacord allows the usage of the powerful command framework ACF for Javacord-based Discord bots. Supports message commands (traditional bot commands), and slash command support is in progress.

### DISCLAIMER
This implementation of ACF is not official. The core of ACF has been marked as not stable enough for new implementations, and the project is not fully finished yet. Use this implementation at your own risk.
